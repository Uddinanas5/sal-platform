## [2026-05-21] fresha-gap: calendar drag-to-reschedule + resize — shipped at 838ba33
- **Files**: src/app/(dashboard)/calendar/client.tsx, src/components/calendar/appointment-block.tsx, src/components/calendar/day-view.tsx, src/components/calendar/three-day-view.tsx, src/components/calendar/week-view.tsx, src/components/calendar/staff-column.tsx, src/lib/actions/appointments.ts
- **Approach**: dnd-kit PointerSensor with 6px activation so click-through to the detail sheet still works. Status-gated — cancelled/no-show/completed are non-draggable. 15-min snap on both drag and resize. New `resizeAppointment` server action mirrors `rescheduleAppointment`'s conflict-check transaction. Optimistic UI with rollback + toast on server error. Drag works day/3-day (cross-staff + cross-time) and week (cross-time, same staff).
- **Verification**: `pnpm lint` ✓. `tsc --noEmit` ✓. `pnpm build` ✓ — initial failures were `next dev` (PID 1588) racing the default `.next/` dir; built green into an isolated `.next-build` distDir via a temporary `NEXT_DIST_DIR` env override (next.config.mjs change reverted before commit). Tester to re-run drag flows against the pushed branch.
- **Rollback**: `git revert 838ba33` on agents/coder.
- **Phase 2 followups (deferred)**: working-hours rejection toast, keyboard a11y verification (Space / arrows / Enter / Esc — KeyboardSensor wired, behaviour to confirm), reschedule-email dedupe for rapid drags, error sanitiser pass for `rescheduleAppointment`/`resizeAppointment` (Prisma-leak pattern Tester flagged on `/api/availability`).
